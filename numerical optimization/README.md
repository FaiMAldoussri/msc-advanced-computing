## Numerical Optimization

This repository contains the assessed coursework and the final project for the Numerical Optimisation module. Both components focus on the mathematical formulation, analysis, and numerical solution of optimisation problems, with particular emphasis on convergence behaviour, robustness, and theoretical justification.

The coursework investigates nonlinear optimisation methods through analytical study and numerical experimentation. It includes derivation of gradients and Hessians, identification and verification of stationary points and minimisers, and analysis of convexity and optimality conditions. Several optimisation algorithms are implemented from scratch, including steepest descent, Newton’s method with line search, the dogleg trust region method, and nonlinear conjugate gradient methods. Their behaviour is studied for different initialisations, and convergence is analysed both theoretically and empirically through appropriate error plots. The work compares local and global convergence properties, examines numerical challenges, and evaluates how theoretical guarantees align with observed performance.

The project formulates a Support Vector Machine classification problem as a mathematical optimisation problem and studies it purely from an optimisation perspective. The focus is on translating the classification task into a rigorous optimisation model, analysing the structure and properties of the resulting problem, and selecting an appropriate optimisation method. The chosen algorithm is implemented from scratch and analysed in terms of convergence type, rate, complexity, and memory usage. Theoretical convergence results are carefully matched to the assumptions of the problem, and empirical behaviour is compared against theoretical predictions. The project emphasises mathematical clarity, structured argumentation, and critical discussion of numerical results rather than classification accuracy.

Together, the coursework and project demonstrate understanding of nonlinear optimisation theory, algorithm design, convergence analysis, and robust numerical implementation.
