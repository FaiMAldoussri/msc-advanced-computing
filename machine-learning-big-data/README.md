## Regression and Classification with AstroML and SDSS Data

This coursework explores regression and classification problems using astronomical data from the astroML package.

The regression task investigates the relationship between distance modulus and redshift, two fundamental quantities in astronomy used to describe distances and the expansion of the Universe.

The classification task focuses on identifying RR Lyrae variable stars using observations from the SDSS survey across the u, g, r, i, and z filter bands. Astronomical colour information derived from these bands is used to distinguish RR Lyrae stars from background stars.

The datasets are loaded directly from astroML.datasets and used for model training and evaluation.
## Deep Learning for Image Classification: From CNNs to Transfer Learning

This coursework explores deep learning techniques for multi-class image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project begins with building a baseline CNN model in TensorFlow and progressively improves it using regularization techniques and transfer learning.

The workflow includes:

-Data preprocessing and dataset handling with TensorFlow Datasets
-Implementation of a custom CNN architecture
-Use of ReLU and Softmax activation functions
-Regularization techniques such as Dropout
-Data augmentation to improve generalization
-Transfer learning using a pre-trained MobileNet model

The goal is to understand how architectural design choices, regularization methods, and pretrained models impact performance. By comparing models trained from scratch with transfer learning approaches, the coursework highlights the practical benefits of leveraging pretrained networks in deep learning applications.
